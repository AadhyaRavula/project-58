        <p>
          My hobby is painting and drawing on the weekends. I paint in the basment where I have all of the supplies like paint, paint brushes, charcol and more. I like to paint becuase, you can be very creative with what you make. You can make silly things or realistic things. I went to art class when I was in kindergarten, 1st grade,  and 2nd, grade. But now I do to go to art class becuase I paint and draw by myself. I am 10 years old and I am in 4th grade my favorit colors are turquoise and pink.
